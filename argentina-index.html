    <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>After declaring independence from Span in 1816, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Paraguay seperated into their own respective countries.  The area that remained would come to be known as Argentina.  Between 1860 and 1930, most of the newcomers traveled to the land came from Italy and Spain, later resulting in the rich culture that is now known throughout the world today.  Prior to the 20th century, Argentina's history contained many different periods of internal political unrest along with several disputes between both the military factions and civillians.</p>

      <p>For a while after World War II, a military junta followed Peronist populism and direct and indirect military interference within subsequent governments.  However, democracy later returned in 1983 after a failed attempt to seize the Falkland Islands by force.  The government persisted, even through an economic crisis that went on from 2001-2002, causing violent protests and the resignation of several presidents, allowing for Nestor and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner rule through Peronist rule.</p>

      <p>In 2015, Mauricio Macri was elected and has been leading the country into an age of reform ever since.</p>
