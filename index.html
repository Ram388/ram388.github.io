      <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida.  If I wasn't at home doing homework or playing video games, I would be spending time with my family and friends.  I have visited many different countries, and have made friends all across the world through an international program in my high school.  I took a strong liking to photography in my junior year of high school and have tried to improve my skills ever since.</p>

      <h2>Current Life</h2>

        <p>Currently, I am attending the University of Miami as a journalism major while living at home with my mother, father, brother, and two dogs.  I still enjoy hanging out with friends and family when I am not working on homework.</p>

        <h3>My current hobbies include:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Basketball</li>
            <li>Soccer</li>

            <li>Going to the beach</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>The Future</h2>

        <p>As mentioned before, I am a journalism major.  I hope to grow and further develop my knowlege in the subject in order to hopefully one day start a career as a photojournalist; I would love to work for either Time Magazine or ESPN.  I hope to stay in Miami because of my love for the city and its culture.</p>
