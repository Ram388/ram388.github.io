      <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida.  If I wasn't at home doing homework or playing video games, I would be spending time with my family and friends.  I have visited many different countries, and have made friends all across the world through an international program in my high school.  I took a strong liking to photography in my junior year of high school and have tried to improve my skills ever since.</p>

      <h2>Current Life</h2>

        <p>Currently, I am attending the University of Miami while living at home with my mother, father, brother, and two dogs.  I am a Journalism major with a strong interest of photography.  I am also beginning a small real estate photography business with a friend </p>

      <h2>The Future</h2>

        <p>As mentioned before, I am a journalism major.  I hope to grow and further develop my knowlege in the subject in order to hopefully one day start a career as a photojournalist; I would love to work for either Time Magazine or ESPN.  I hope to stay in Miami because of my love for the city and it's culture.</p>
