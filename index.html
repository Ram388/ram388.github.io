      <h1>Raul Maristany</h1>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <p>Since I was young, I have lived in Miami; I am Cuban and Hispanic.  For elementary and middle school I attended St. John Neumann Catholic School, and for high school I attended St. Brendan High School.  Throughout those years I developed my likes and dislikes, and made life long friends</p>

      <h2>Current Life</h2>

        <p>Currently, I am attending the University of Miami while living at home with my mother, father, brother, and two dogs.  I am a Journalism major with a strong interest of photography.  I am also beginning a small real estate photography business with a friend </p>

      <h2>The Future</h2>

        <p>As mentioned before, I am a journalism major.  I hope to grow and further develop my knowlege in the subject in order to hopefully one day start a career as a photojournalist; I would love to work for either Time Magazine or ESPN.  I hope to stay in Miami because of my love for the city and it's culture.</p>
